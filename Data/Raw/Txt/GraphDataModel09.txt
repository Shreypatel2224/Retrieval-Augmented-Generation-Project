Introduction to the Graph Data Model

What is a Graph Database?
- A data model based on the graph data structure.
- Composed of nodes and edges.
  - Edges connect nodes.
  - Each node and edge is uniquely identified.
  - Each can contain properties (e.g., name, occupation, etc.).
- Supports queries based on graph-oriented operations:
  - Traversals.
  - Shortest path.
  - Many others.

Where do Graphs Show Up?
- Social Networks:
  - Platforms like Instagram.
  - Modeling social interactions in fields like psychology and sociology.
- The Web:
  - A big graph of “pages” (nodes) connected by hyperlinks (edges).
- Chemical and biological data:
  - Systems biology, genetics, etc.
  - Interaction relationships in chemistry.

Basics of Graphs and Graph Theory

What is a Graph?
- Labeled Property Graph:
  - Composed of a set of node (vertex) objects and relationship (edge) objects.
  - Labels are used to mark a node as part of a group.
  - Properties are attributes (think key-value pairs) and can exist on nodes and relationships.
  - Nodes with no associated relationships are OK. Edges not connected to nodes are not permitted.

Example:
- 2 Labels: person, car.
- 4 relationship types: Drives, Owns, Lives_with, Married_to.
- Properties: Attributes like name, age, etc.

Paths:
- A path is an ordered sequence of nodes connected by edges in which no nodes or edges are repeated.
  - Example: 1 → 2 → 6 → 5.
  - Not a path: 1 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 3.

Flavors of Graphs:
- Connected (vs. Disconnected): There is a path between any two nodes in the graph.
- Weighted (vs. Unweighted): Edges have a weight property (important for some algorithms).
- Directed (vs. Undirected): Relationships (edges) define a start and end node.
- Acyclic (vs. Cyclic): Graph contains no cycles.
- Sparse (vs. Dense): Few vs. many edges relative to the number of nodes.
- Trees: A type of graph with no cycles and a hierarchical structure.

Types of Graph Algorithms - Pathfinding:
- Pathfinding:
  - Finding the shortest path between two nodes, if one exists, is probably the most common operation.
  - “Shortest” means fewest edges or lowest weight.
  - Average Shortest Path can be used to monitor efficiency and resiliency of networks.
  - Minimum spanning tree, cycle detection, max/min flow… are other types of pathfinding.

BFS vs DFS:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Shortest Path:
- Algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A* are used to find the shortest path between nodes.

Types of Graph Algorithms - Centrality & Community Detection:
- Centrality:
  - Determining which nodes are “more important” in a network compared to other nodes.
  - Example: Social Network Influencers.
- Community Detection:
  - Evaluating clustering or partitioning of nodes of a graph and tendency to strengthen or break apart.

Centrality:
- Measures the importance of nodes in a graph (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality, etc.).

Some Famous Graph Algorithms:
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm: Single-source shortest path algorithm for positively weighted graphs.
- A* Algorithm: Similar to Dijkstra’s with added feature of using a heuristic to guide traversal.
- PageRank: Measures the importance of each node within a graph based on the number of incoming relationships and the importance of the nodes from those incoming relationships.

Neo4j:
- A Graph Database System that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graph-based data.
- Relatively new class of NoSQL DBs.
- Considered schema optional (one can be imposed).
- Supports various types of indexing.
- ACID compliant.
- Supports distributed computing.
- Similar systems: Microsoft CosmoDB, Amazon Neptune.
