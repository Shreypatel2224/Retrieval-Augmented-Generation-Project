Amazon EC2 and AWS Lambda Guide

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Cloud Compute):
- EC2 provides scalable virtual computing in the cloud.
- Features:
  - Many instance types available.
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model.
  - Supports multiple operating systems.

Features of EC2:
- Elasticity: Easily and programmatically scale instances up or down as needed.
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image): Use standard AMIs or provide your own for pre-configuration.
- Integration: Easily integrates with other AWS services like S3, RDS, etc.

EC2 Lifecycle:
- Launch: Starting an instance for the first time with a chosen configuration.
- Start/Stop: Temporarily suspend usage without deleting the instance.
- Terminate: Permanently delete the instance.
- Reboot: Restart an instance without losing data on the root volume.

Where Can You Store Data?
- Instance Store: Temporary, high-speed storage tied to the instance lifecycle.
- EFS (Elastic File System): Shared file storage.
- EBS (Elastic Block Storage): Persistent block-level storage.
- S3: Large dataset storage or EC2 backups.

Common EC2 Use Cases:
- Web Hosting: Run a website/web server and associated apps.
- Data Processing: Perform any data-related tasks using programming languages.
- Machine Learning: Train models using GPU instances.
- Disaster Recovery: Backup critical workloads or infrastructure in the cloud.

AWS Lambda:
- Provides serverless computing.
- Automatically runs code in response to events.
- Relieves you from managing servers; focus only on the code.
- Pay only for execution time, not for idle compute time (unlike EC2).

Lambda Features:
- Event-driven execution: Can be triggered by many different events in AWS.
- Supports multiple runtimes: Python, Java, Node.js, etc.
- Highly integrated with other AWS services.
- Extremely scalable and can rapidly adjust to demands.

How Lambda Works:
1. Add/upload your code through the AWS Management Console.
2. Configure event source(s).
3. Watch your Lambda run when one of the event sources fires an event.
