Amazon Web Services (AWS)

AWS is the leading cloud platform with over 200 different services available. It is globally accessible via its massive network of regions and availability zones, supported by extensive data centers. AWS operates on a pay-as-you-use cost model, which is theoretically cheaper than renting rackspace/servers in a traditional data center.

History of AWS:
- Originally launched in 2006 with only 2 services: S3 (Simple Storage Service) and EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud).
- By 2010, services expanded to include SimpleDB, Elastic Block Store, Relational Database Service (RDS), DynamoDB, CloudWatch, Simple Workflow, CloudFront, Availability Zones, and others.
- Amazon held competitions with big prizes to spur the adoption of AWS in its early days.
- AWS has continuously innovated, introducing new services for operations, development, analytics, and more (now over 200 services).

AWS Service Categories:
- Compute, Storage, Database, Analytics, Machine Learning, Networking, Security, and more.

Cloud Models:
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):
  - Provides basic services needed to build an IT infrastructure.
- PaaS (Platform as a Service):
  - Removes the need to manage infrastructure, allowing direct deployment of applications.
- SaaS (Software as a Service):
  - Provides full software applications run and managed by another party/vendor.

The Shared Responsibility Model - AWS:
- AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the cloud):
  - Security of physical infrastructure and network.
  - Maintain power availability, HVAC, and physical networking equipment.
  - Manage the virtualization layer and host OSs.
  - Maintain managed services (e.g., patching, server software).
- Client Responsibilities (Security IN the cloud):
  - Control of data/content (classification, encryption, sharing).
  - Configure IAM users, roles, and policies (enforce the Principle of Least Privilege).
  - Manage self-hosted apps and associated OSs.
  - Ensure network security in VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
  - Handle compliance and governance policies.

The AWS Global Infrastructure:
- Regions: Distinct geographical areas (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-1).
- Availability Zones (AZs): Isolated data centers within a region.
- Edge Locations: Locations for CDN (Content Delivery Network) and caching services, bringing content closer to end users.

Compute Services:
- VM-based: EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) and EC2 Spot.
- Container-based: ECS (Elastic Container Service), ECR (Elastic Container Registry), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), Fargate (Serverless container service).
- Serverless: AWS Lambda.

Storage Services:
- Amazon S3: Simple Storage Service (object storage in buckets, highly scalable).
- Amazon EFS: Elastic File System (serverless, elastic file system).
- Amazon EBS: Elastic Block Storage (high-performance block storage).
- Amazon File Cache: High-speed cache for datasets.
- AWS Backup: Fully managed, policy-based service for data protection and compliance.

Database Services:
- Relational: Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora.
- Key-Value: Amazon DynamoDB.
- In-Memory: Amazon MemoryDB, Amazon ElastiCache.
- Document: Amazon DocumentDB (compatible with MongoDB).
- Graph: Amazon Neptune.

Analytics Services:
- Amazon Athena: Analyze petabyte-scale data where it lives (e.g., S3).
- Amazon EMR: Elastic MapReduce (access Apache Spark, Hive, Presto, etc.).
- AWS Glue: Discover, prepare, and integrate data.
- Amazon Redshift: Data warehousing service.
- Amazon Kinesis: Real-time data streaming.
- Amazon QuickSight: Cloud-native BI/reporting tool.

Machine Learning and AI Services:
- Amazon SageMaker: Fully managed ML platform, including Jupyter Notebooks.
- AWS AI Services with Pre-trained Models:
  - Amazon Comprehend: NLP (Natural Language Processing).
  - Amazon Rekognition: Image/Video analysis.
  - Amazon Textract: Text extraction.
  - Amazon Translate: Machine translation.

Important Services for Data Analytics/Engineering:
- EC2 and Lambda.
- Amazon S3.
- Amazon RDS and DynamoDB.
- AWS Glue.
- Amazon Athena.
- Amazon EMR.
- Amazon Redshift.

AWS Free Tier:
- Allows hands-on experience with a subset of services for 12 months (service limitations apply).
- Examples:
  - Amazon EC2: 750 hours/month (specific OSs and instance sizes).
  - Amazon S3: 5GB (20K GETs, 2K PUTs).
  - Amazon RDS: 750 hours/month of DB use (within certain limits).
