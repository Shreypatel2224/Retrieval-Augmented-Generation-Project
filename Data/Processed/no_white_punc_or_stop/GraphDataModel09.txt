Introduction Graph Data Model Graph Database data model based graph data structure Composed nodes edges Edges connect nodes node edge uniquely identified contain properties eg name occupation etc Supports queries based graphoriented operations Traversals Shortest path Many others Graphs Show Social Networks Platforms like Instagram Modeling social interactions fields like psychology sociology Web big graph “pages” nodes connected hyperlinks edges Chemical biological data Systems biology genetics etc Interaction relationships chemistry Basics Graphs Graph Theory Graph Labeled Property Graph Composed set node vertex objects relationship edge objects Labels used mark node part group Properties attributes think keyvalue pairs exist nodes relationships Nodes associated relationships OK Edges connected nodes permitted Example 2 Labels person car 4 relationship types Drives Owns Liveswith Marriedto Properties Attributes like name age etc Paths path ordered sequence nodes connected edges nodes edges repeated Example 1 → 2 → 6 → 5 path 1 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 3 Flavors Graphs Connected vs Disconnected path two nodes graph Weighted vs Unweighted Edges weight property important algorithms Directed vs Undirected Relationships edges define start end node Acyclic vs Cyclic Graph contains cycles Sparse vs Dense vs many edges relative number nodes Trees type graph cycles hierarchical structure Types Graph Algorithms Pathfinding Pathfinding Finding shortest path two nodes one exists probably common operation “Shortest” means fewest edges lowest weight Average Shortest Path used monitor efficiency resiliency networks Minimum spanning tree cycle detection maxmin flow… types pathfinding BFS vs DFS BreadthFirst Search BFS Explores neighbors present depth moving nodes next depth level DepthFirst Search DFS Explores far possible along branch backtracking Shortest Path Algorithms like Dijkstra’s used find shortest path nodes Types Graph Algorithms Centrality Community Detection Centrality Determining nodes “more important” network compared nodes Example Social Network Influencers Community Detection Evaluating clustering partitioning nodes graph tendency strengthen break apart Centrality Measures importance nodes graph eg degree centrality betweenness centrality etc Famous Graph Algorithms Dijkstra’s Algorithm Singlesource shortest path algorithm positively weighted graphs Algorithm Similar Dijkstra’s added feature using heuristic guide traversal PageRank Measures importance node within graph based number incoming relationships importance nodes incoming relationships Neo4j Graph Database System supports transactional analytical processing graphbased data Relatively new class NoSQL DBs Considered schema optional one imposed Supports various types indexing ACID compliant Supports distributed computing Similar systems Microsoft CosmoDB Amazon Neptune
