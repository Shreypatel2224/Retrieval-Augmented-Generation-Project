Document Database A Document Database is a nonrelational database that stores data as structured documents usually in JSON They are designed to be simple flexible and scalable What is JSON  JSON JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight datainterchange format  It is easy for humans to read and write  It is easy for machines to parse and generate  JSON is built on two structures  A collection of namevalue pairs object record struct dictionary hash table keyed list or associative array  An ordered list of values array vector list or sequence  These are universal data structures supported by virtually all modern programming languages making JSON a great data interchange format JSON Syntax  Refer to JSON syntax documentation httpswwwjsonorgjsonenhtml Binary JSON BSON  BSON Binary JSON is a binaryencoded serialization of a JSONlike document structure  Supports extended types not part of basic JSON eg Date BinaryData etc  Lightweight Keeps space overhead to a minimum  Traversable Designed to be easily traversed which is vitally important to a document DB  Efficient Encoding and decoding must be efficient  Supported by many modern programming languages XML eXtensible Markup Language  Precursor to JSON as a data exchange format  XML  CSS → web pages that separated content and formatting  Structurally similar to HTML but the tag set is extensible XMLRelated ToolsTechnologies  XPath A syntax for retrieving specific elements from an XML document  XQuery A query language for interrogating XML documents the SQL of XML  DTD Document Type Definition A language for describing the allowed structure of an XML document  XSLT eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation A tool to transform XML into other formats including nonXML formats such as HTML Why Document Databases  Document databases address the impedance mismatch problem between object persistence in OO systems and how relational DBs structure data  OO Programming → Inheritance and Composition of types Saving a complex object to a relational database requires deconstructing it  The structure of a document is selfdescribing  They are wellaligned with apps that use JSONXML as a transport layer MongoDB  Started in 2007 after DoubleClick was acquired by Google and 3 of its veterans realized the limitations of relational databases for serving  400000 ads per second  MongoDB was short for Humongous Database  MongoDB Atlas released in 2016 → document DB as a service MongoDB Structure  Database  Collection A  Document 1  Document 2  Document 3  Collection B  Document 1  Document 2  Document 3  Collection C  Document 1  Document 2  Document 3 MongoDB Documents  No predefined schema for documents is needed  Every document in a collection could have different dataschema Relational vs MongoDBDocument DB  RDBMS Database → TableView → Row → Column → Index → Join → Foreign Key  MongoDB Database → Collection → Document → Field → Index → Embedded Document → Reference MongoDB Features  Rich Query Support Robust support for all CRUD operations  Indexing Supports primary and secondary indices on document fields  Replication Supports replica sets with automatic failover  Load balancing built in MongoDB Versions  MongoDB Atlas Fully managed MongoDB service in the cloud DBaaS  MongoDB Enterprise Subscriptionbased selfmanaged version of MongoDB  MongoDB
