used specifically correct imbalances detected insertions removals insertion algorithm Inserting key AVL tree starts way insertion binary search tree Perform lookup find key already tree youre done keys binary search tree must unique lookup terminates without key found add new node appropriate leaf position lookup ended problem adding new node introduced possibility imbalance example suppose started AVL tree inserted key 35 binary search tree insertion would give us result 31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 57But resulting tree AVL tree node containing key 40 AVL property difference heights subtrees 2 left subtree height 1 right subtree — empty — height 1 answer lies following algorithm perform normal insertion process Work way back tree position added node could quite simple insertion done recursively Compare heights left right subtrees node differ 1 choose rotation fix imbalance Note comparing heights left right subtrees
