learned previously isnt good way try solve particular recurrence prove something interesting quite easily know sure AVL trees larger heights bigger minimum number nodes AVL trees smaller heights — thats fairly selfexplanatory — means sure 1 Mh − 1 ≥ Mh − 2 Given conclude following Mh ≥ 2Mh 2 use repeated substitution technique determine lower bound recurrence Mh ≥ 2Mh 2 ≥ 22Mh 4 ≥ 4Mh 4 ≥ 42Mh 6 ≥ 8Mh 6 ≥ 2jMh 2j could prove induction j well accept faith let j h2 ≥ 2h2Mh h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 weve shown minimum number nodes present AVL tree height h least 2h2 reality actually gives us something useful work use result figure really interested opposite height AVL tree n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥ h Finally see AVL trees height h minimum number nodes height 2 log2n n number nodes tree AVL trees minimum number nodes relationship number nodes height even better though reasons weve seen previously know relationship number nodes height binary tree never better logarithmic ultimately
