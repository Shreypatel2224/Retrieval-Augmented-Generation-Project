BTrees idea saw earlier putting multiple set list hash table elements together large chunks exploit locality also applied trees Binary search trees good locality given node binary tree probably occupies fraction cache line Btrees way get better locality putting multiple elements tree node Btrees originally invented storing data structures disk locality even crucial memory Accessing disk location takes 5ms 5000000ns Therefore storing tree disk want make sure given disk read effective possible Btrees high branching factor much larger 2 ensures disk reads needed navigate place data stored B trees may also useful inmemory data structures days main memory almost slow relative processor disk drives main memory Btrees first introduced Btree order search tree nonleaf node children actual elements collection stored leaves tree nonleaf nodes contain keys leaf stores number elements maximum number may greater typically less data structure satisfies several invariants 1 Every path root leaf length
