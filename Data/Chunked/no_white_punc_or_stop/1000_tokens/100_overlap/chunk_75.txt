AVL trees height n ≥ 2 minimum number nodes share similar property AVL tree height h ≥ 2 minimum number nodes consists root node two subtrees one AVL tree height h − 1 minimum number nodes AVL tree height h − 2 minimum number nodes Given observation write recurrence describes number nodes minimum AVL tree height h M0 1 height 0 minimum number nodes 1 root node children M1 2 height 1 minimum number nodes 2 root node one child Mh 1 Mh 1 Mh 2 repeated substitution technique learned previously isnt good way try solve particular recurrence prove something interesting quite easily know sure AVL trees larger heights bigger minimum number nodes AVL trees smaller heights — thats fairly selfexplanatory — means sure 1 Mh − 1 ≥ Mh − 2 Given conclude following Mh ≥ 2Mh 2 use repeated substitution technique determine lower bound recurrence Mh ≥ 2Mh 2 ≥ 22Mh 4 ≥ 4Mh 4 ≥ 42Mh 6 ≥ 8Mh 6 ≥ 2jMh 2j could prove induction j well accept faith let j h2 ≥ 2h2Mh h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 weve shown minimum number
