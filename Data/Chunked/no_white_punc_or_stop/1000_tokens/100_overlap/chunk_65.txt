proceed complete binary tree would great goal us attain could keep shape binary search trees complete would always binary search trees height Θlog n cost maintaining completeness trouble course need algorithm maintaining completeness go trouble trying figure one consider whether even worth time deduce cost maintaining completeness even havent figured algorithm yet One example demonstrates big problem Suppose binary search tree left — complete definition — wanted insert key 1 would need algorithm would transform tree left tree right31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 27The tree right certainly complete would outcome wed want consider would take Every key tree move matter algorithm used would still move every key n keys tree would take Ωn time — moving n keys takes least linear time even best possible algorithm moving work still get done worst case maintaining completeness single insertion requires Ωn time Unfortunately time
