keys might want store Complete binary trees somewhat relaxed notion perfection something called complete binary tree defined follows complete binary tree height h binary tree h 0 left right subtrees empty h 0 one two things true left subtree perfect binary tree height h − 1 right subtree complete binary tree height h − 1 left subtree complete binary tree height h − 1 right subtree perfect binary tree height h − 2 bit mindbending definition actually leads conceptually simple result every level complete binary tree every node could possibly present except last level might missing nodes missing nodes nodes far left possible following complete binary trees Furthermore possible complete binary trees numbers nodes arrangement say 6 keys besides one shown would violate definition Weve seen height perfect binary tree Θlog n stretch see height complete binary tree Θlog n well well accept via intuition proceed complete binary tree would great goal us attain could keep shape binary search trees
