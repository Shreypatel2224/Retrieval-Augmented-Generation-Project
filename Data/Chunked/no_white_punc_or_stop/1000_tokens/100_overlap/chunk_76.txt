prove induction j well accept faith let j h2 ≥ 2h2Mh h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 weve shown minimum number nodes present AVL tree height h least 2h2 reality actually gives us something useful work use result figure really interested opposite height AVL tree n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥ h Finally see AVL trees height h minimum number nodes height 2 log2n n number nodes tree AVL trees minimum number nodes relationship number nodes height even better though reasons weve seen previously know relationship number nodes height binary tree never better logarithmic ultimately see height AVL tree n nodes Θlog n reality turns bound lower 2 log2n something akin 144 log2n even AVL trees minimum number nodes though proof involved doesnt change asymptotic result31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 77
