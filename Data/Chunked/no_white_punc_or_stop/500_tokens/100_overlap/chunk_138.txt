take Every key tree move matter algorithm used would still move every key n keys tree would take Ωn time — moving n keys takes least linear time even best possible algorithm moving work still get done worst case maintaining completeness single insertion requires Ωn time Unfortunately time ought spending maintaining balance means well need come compromise often case learn design algorithms willingness tolerate imperfect result thats still good enough uses often lead algorithm much faster one
