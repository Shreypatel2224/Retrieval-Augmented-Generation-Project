circle B written single node containing single key triangles T1 T2 T3 written arbitrary subtrees may empty may contain number nodes binary search trees important remember trees — — binary search trees rotation doesnt harm ordering keys nodes subtrees T1 T2 T3 maintain appropriate positions relative keys B keys T1 smaller keys T2 larger smaller B keys T3 larger B Performing rotation would simple matter adjusting pointers — notably constant number pointers matter many nodes tree means rotation
