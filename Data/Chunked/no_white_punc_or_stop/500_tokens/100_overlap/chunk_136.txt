tree Θlog n stretch see height complete binary tree Θlog n well well accept via intuition proceed complete binary tree would great goal us attain could keep shape binary search trees complete would always binary search trees height Θlog n cost maintaining completeness trouble course need algorithm maintaining completeness go trouble trying figure one consider whether even worth time deduce cost maintaining completeness even havent figured algorithm yet One example demonstrates big problem
