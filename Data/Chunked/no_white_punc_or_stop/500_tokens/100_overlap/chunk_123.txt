nodes “more important” network compared nodes Example Social Network Influencers Community Detection Evaluating clustering partitioning nodes graph tendency strengthen break apart Centrality Measures importance nodes graph eg degree centrality betweenness centrality etc Famous Graph Algorithms Dijkstra’s Algorithm Singlesource shortest path algorithm positively weighted graphs Algorithm Similar Dijkstra’s added feature using heuristic guide traversal PageRank Measures importance node within
