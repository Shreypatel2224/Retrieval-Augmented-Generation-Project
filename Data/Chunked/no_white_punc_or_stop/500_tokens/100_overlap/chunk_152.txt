quite simple insertion done recursively Compare heights left right subtrees node differ 1 choose rotation fix imbalance Note comparing heights left right subtrees would quite expensive didnt already know solution problem node store height ie height subtree rooted cheaply updated every insertion removal unwind recursion rotation chosen considering two links along path node imbalance heading back toward inserted node wondering names RR LR RL come answer mystery two links left perform rotation
