note keeping nodes fuller result less space required less empty space disk file efficient processing fewer blocks average read memory amount information block greater Btrees become popular many algorithm designers tried improve Btree performance One method use tree variant known tree tree identical tree except rules used split merge nodes Instead splitting node half overflows tree gives records neighboring sibling possible sibling also full two nodes split three Similarly node underflows
