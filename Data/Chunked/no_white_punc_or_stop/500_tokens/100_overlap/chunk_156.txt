similar insertions sense would start usual binary search tree removal algorithm find correct imbalances recursion unwinds key difference removals require one rotation correct imbalances still require rotations path back root removal occurred — generally Olog n rotations Asymptotic analysis key question height AVL tree n nodes answer Θlog n certain lookups insertions removals take Olog n time sure Lookups would Olog n theyre binary search tree doesnt AVL property height tree Θlog n lookups run
