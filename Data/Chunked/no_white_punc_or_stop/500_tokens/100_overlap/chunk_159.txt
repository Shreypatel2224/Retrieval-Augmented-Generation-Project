root node two subtrees one AVL tree height h − 1 minimum number nodes AVL tree height h − 2 minimum number nodes Given observation write recurrence describes number nodes minimum AVL tree height h M0 1 height 0 minimum number nodes 1 root node children M1 2 height 1 minimum number nodes 2 root node one child Mh 1 Mh 1 Mh 2 repeated substitution technique learned previously isnt good way try solve particular recurrence prove something interesting quite easily know sure AVL trees larger heights
