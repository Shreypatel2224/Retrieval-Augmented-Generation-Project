representation tree node interface Leaf node internal node subclasses would implement interface Interface B Tree nodes public interface BPNodeKeyE public boolean isLeaf public int numrecs public Key keys important implementation detail note Figure 1261 shows internal nodes containing three keys four pointers class BPNode slightly different stores keypointer pairs Figure 1261 shows tree traditionally drawn simplify implementation practice nodes really associate key pointer internal node assumed
