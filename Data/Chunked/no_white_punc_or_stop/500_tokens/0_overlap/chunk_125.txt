trees important remember trees — — binary search trees rotation doesnt harm ordering keys nodes subtrees T1 T2 T3 maintain appropriate positions relative keys B keys T1 smaller keys T2 larger smaller B keys T3 larger B Performing rotation would simple matter adjusting pointers — notably constant number pointers matter many nodes tree means rotation would run Θ1 time Bs parent would point used point B right child would B instead root T2 Bs left child would root T2 instead second kind rotation RR
