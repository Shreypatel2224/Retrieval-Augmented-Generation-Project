perfect binary tree height h − 2 bit mindbending definition actually leads conceptually simple result every level complete binary tree every node could possibly present except last level might missing nodes missing nodes nodes far left possible following complete binary trees Furthermore possible complete binary trees numbers nodes arrangement say 6 keys besides one shown would violate definition Weve seen height perfect binary tree Θlog n stretch see height complete binary tree Θlog n well
