h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 weve shown minimum number nodes present AVL tree height h least 2h2 reality actually gives us something useful work use result figure really interested opposite height AVL tree n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥ h Finally see AVL trees height h minimum number nodes height 2 log2n n number nodes tree AVL trees minimum number nodes relationship number nodes height even better though reasons weve seen previously know relationship number nodes height binary tree never better
