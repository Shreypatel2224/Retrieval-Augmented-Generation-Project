Rebalancing AVL trees achieved using called rotations used proper times efficiently improve shape tree altering handful pointers kinds rotations first understand work focus attention use first kind rotation called rotation takes tree left turns tree right circle B written single node containing single key triangles T1 T2 T3 written arbitrary subtrees may empty may contain number nodes binary search trees important remember trees — — binary search trees rotation doesnt harm ordering keys nodes
