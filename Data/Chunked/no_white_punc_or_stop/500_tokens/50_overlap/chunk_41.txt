BTrees idea saw earlier putting multiple set list hash table elements together large chunks exploit locality also applied trees Binary search trees good locality given node binary tree probably occupies fraction cache line Btrees way get better locality putting multiple elements tree node Btrees originally invented storing data structures disk locality even crucial memory Accessing disk location takes 5ms 5000000ns Therefore storing tree disk want make sure given disk read effective possible
