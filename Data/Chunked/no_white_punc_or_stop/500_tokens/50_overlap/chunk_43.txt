number may greater typically less data structure satisfies several invariants 1 Every path root leaf length 2 node n children contains nâˆ’1 keys 3 Every node except root least half full 4 elements stored given subtree keys keys parent node either side subtree pointer generalizes BST invariant 5 root least two children leaf example following order5 Btree m5 leaves enough space store 3 data records height tree uniformly every node least half full guaranteed asymptotic performance Olg n n size
