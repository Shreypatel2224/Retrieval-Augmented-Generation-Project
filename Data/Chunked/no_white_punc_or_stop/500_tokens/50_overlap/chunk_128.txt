get done worst case maintaining completeness single insertion requires Î©n time Unfortunately time ought spending maintaining balance means well need come compromise often case learn design algorithms willingness tolerate imperfect result thats still good enough uses often lead algorithm much faster one achieves perfect result would good enough result good balance condition overall goal lookups insertions removals binary search tree require Olog n time every case rather letting degrade worstcase
