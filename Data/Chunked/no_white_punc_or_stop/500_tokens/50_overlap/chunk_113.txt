Explores far possible along branch backtracking Shortest Path Algorithms like Dijkstra’s used find shortest path nodes Types Graph Algorithms Centrality Community Detection Centrality Determining nodes “more important” network compared nodes Example Social Network Influencers Community Detection Evaluating clustering partitioning nodes graph tendency strengthen break apart Centrality Measures importance nodes graph eg degree centrality betweenness centrality etc Famous Graph Algorithms
