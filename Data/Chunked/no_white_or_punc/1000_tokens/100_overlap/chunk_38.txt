one or both models  Network partitioning is inevitable  Network failures system failures  Overall system needs to be Partition Tolerant  The system can keep running even with a network partition The CAP Theorem  The CAP Theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees  Consistency Every read receives the most recent write or an error  Availability Every request receives a nonerror response but no guarantee that the response contains the most recent write  Partition Tolerance The system can continue to operate despite arbitrary network issues CAP Theorem  Database View  Consistency Every user of the DB has an identical view of the data at any given instant  Availability In the event of a failure the database remains operational  Partition Tolerance The database can maintain operations in the event of the networkâ€™s failing between two segments of the distributed system  Note The definition of
