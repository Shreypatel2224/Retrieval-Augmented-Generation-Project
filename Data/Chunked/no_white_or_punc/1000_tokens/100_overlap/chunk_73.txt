tendency to strengthen or break apart Centrality  Measures the importance of nodes in a graph eg degree centrality betweenness centrality etc Some Famous Graph Algorithms  Dijkstra’s Algorithm Singlesource shortest path algorithm for positively weighted graphs  A Algorithm Similar to Dijkstra’s with added feature of using a heuristic to guide traversal  PageRank Measures the importance of each node within a graph based on the number of incoming relationships and the importance of the nodes from those incoming relationships Neo4j  A Graph Database System that supports both transactional and analytical processing of graphbased data  Relatively new class of NoSQL DBs  Considered schema optional one can be imposed  Supports various types of indexing  ACID compliant  Supports distributed computing  Similar systems Microsoft CosmoDB Amazon Neptune
