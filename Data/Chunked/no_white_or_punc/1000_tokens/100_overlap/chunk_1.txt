126 BTrees 1261 BTrees This module presents the Btree Btrees are usually attributed to R Bayer and E McCreight who described the Btree in a 1972 paper By 1979 Btrees had replaced virtually all largefile access methods other than hashing Btrees or some variant of Btrees are the standard file organization for applications requiring insertion deletion and key range searches They are used to implement most modern file systems Btrees address effectively all of the major problems encountered when implementing diskbased search trees 1 The Btree is shallow in part because the tree is always height balanced all leaf nodes are at the same level and in part because the branching factor is quite high So only a small number of disk blocks are accessed to reach a given record 2 Update and search operations affect only those disk blocks on the path from the root to the leaf node containing the query record The fewer the number of disk blocks affected during an operation the less disk IO is required 3
