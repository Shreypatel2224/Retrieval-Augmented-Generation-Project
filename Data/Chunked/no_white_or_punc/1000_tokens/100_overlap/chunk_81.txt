of say 6 keys besides the one shown above would violate the definition Weve seen that the height of a perfect binary tree is Θlog n Its not a stretch to see that the height a complete binary tree will be Θlog n as well and well accept that via our intuition for now and proceed All in all a complete binary tree would be a great goal for us to attain If we could keep the shape of our binary search trees complete we would always have binary search trees with height Θlog n The cost of maintaining completeness The trouble of course is that we need an algorithm for maintaining completeness And before we go to the trouble of trying to figure one out we should consider whether its even worth our time What can we deduce about the cost of maintaining completeness even if we havent figured out an algorithm yet One example demonstrates a very big problem Suppose we had the binary search tree on the left — which is complete by our definition — and we wanted to insert the key 1 into it If so we
