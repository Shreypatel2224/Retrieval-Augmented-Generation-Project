and can exist on nodes and relationships  Nodes with no associated relationships are OK Edges not connected to nodes are not permitted Example  2 Labels person car  4 relationship types Drives Owns Liveswith Marriedto  Properties Attributes like name age etc Paths  A path is an ordered sequence of nodes connected by edges in which no nodes or edges are repeated  Example 1 → 2 → 6 → 5  Not a path 1 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 3 Flavors of Graphs  Connected vs Disconnected There is a path between any two nodes in the graph  Weighted vs Unweighted Edges have a weight property important for some algorithms  Directed vs Undirected Relationships edges define a start and end node  Acyclic vs Cyclic Graph contains no cycles  Sparse vs Dense Few vs many edges relative to the number of nodes  Trees A type of graph with no cycles and a hierarchical structure Types of Graph Algorithms  Pathfinding  Pathfinding  Finding the shortest path between two nodes if one exists is probably the most common operation
