can be used to fill the gap If so then enough records are transferred from the sibling so that both nodes have about the same number of records This is done so as to delay as long as possible the next time when a delete causes this node to underflow again This process might require that the parent node has its placeholder key value revised to reflect the true first key value in each node If neither sibling can lend a record to the underfull node call it  then must give its records to a sibling and be removed from the tree There is certainly room to do this because the sibling is at most half full remember that it had no records to contribute to the current node and has become less than half full because it is underflowing This merge process combines two subtrees of the parent which might cause it to underflow in turn If the last two children of the root merge together then the tree loses a level Here is a Javalike pseudocode for the tree delete algorithm  Delete a record with the
