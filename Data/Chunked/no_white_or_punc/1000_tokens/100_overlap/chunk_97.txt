root node with no children M1  2 When height is 1 minimum number of nodes is 2 a root node with one child and not the other Mh  1  Mh  1  Mh  2 While the repeated substitution technique we learned previously isnt a good way to try to solve this particular recurrence we can prove something interesting quite easily We know for sure that AVL trees with larger heights have a bigger minimum number of nodes than AVL trees with smaller heights — thats fairly selfexplanatory — which means that we can be sure that 1  Mh − 1 ≥ Mh − 2 Given that we can conclude the following Mh ≥ 2Mh  2 We can then use the repeated substitution technique to determine a lower bound for this recurrence Mh ≥ 2Mh  2 ≥ 22Mh  4 ≥ 4Mh  4 ≥ 42Mh  6 ≥ 8Mh  6  ≥ 2jMh  2j We could prove this by induction on j but well accept it on faith let j  h2 ≥ 2h2Mh  h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 So weve shown that the minimum number of nodes that can be present in an AVL tree of height h is at least 2h2 In reality its actually more than that
