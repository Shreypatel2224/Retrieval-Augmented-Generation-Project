Finding the shortest path between two nodes if one exists is probably the most common operation  “Shortest” means fewest edges or lowest weight  Average Shortest Path can be used to monitor efficiency and resiliency of networks  Minimum spanning tree cycle detection maxmin flow… are other types of pathfinding BFS vs DFS  BreadthFirst Search BFS Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level  DepthFirst Search DFS Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking Shortest Path  Algorithms like Dijkstra’s and A are used to find the shortest path between nodes Types of Graph Algorithms  Centrality  Community Detection  Centrality  Determining which nodes are “more important” in a network compared to other nodes  Example Social Network Influencers  Community Detection  Evaluating clustering or partitioning of nodes of a graph and tendency to strengthen or break apart Centrality  Measures the importance of nodes in a graph eg
