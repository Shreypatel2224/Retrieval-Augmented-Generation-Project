it guarantees that the height of the tree is still logarithmic which will give us logarithmictime lookups and the time spent re balancing wont exceed the logarithmic time we would otherwise spend on an insertion or removal when the tree has logarithmic height The cost wont outweigh the benefit Coming up with a balance condition like this on our own is a tall task but we can stand on the shoulders of the giants who came before us with the definition above helping to guide us toward an understanding of whether weve found what were looking for A compromise AVL trees There are a few wellknown approaches for maintaining binary search trees in a state of nearbalance that meets our notion of a good balance condition One of them is called an AVL tree which well explore here Others which are outside the scope of this course include redblack trees which meet our definition of good and splay trees which dont always meet our definition of good but do meet it on an amortized basis but well stick
