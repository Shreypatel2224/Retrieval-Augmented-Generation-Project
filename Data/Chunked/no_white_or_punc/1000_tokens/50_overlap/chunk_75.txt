and are the only possible perfect shapes for binary trees with that number of nodes The problem though lies in the fact that there is no valid perfect binary tree with 2 nodes or with 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14 nodes So generally its impossible for us to guarantee that a binary search tree will always be perfect by our definition because theres simply no way to represent most numbers of keys So first things first Well need to relax our definition of perfection to accommodate every possible number of keys we might want to store Complete binary trees A somewhat more relaxed notion of perfection is something called a complete binary tree which is defined as follows A complete binary tree of height h is a binary tree where If h  0 its left and right subtrees are empty  If h  0 one of two things is true The left subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 The left subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 and the
