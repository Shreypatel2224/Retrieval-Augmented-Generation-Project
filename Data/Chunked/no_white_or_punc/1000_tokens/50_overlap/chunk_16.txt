there is less empty space in the disk file and in more efficient processing fewer blocks on average will be read into memory because the amount of information in each block is greater Because Btrees have become so popular many algorithm designers have tried to improve Btree performance One method for doing so is to use the tree variant known as the tree The tree is identical to the tree except for the rules used to split and merge nodes Instead of splitting a node in half when it overflows the tree gives some records to its neighboring sibling if possible If the sibling is also full then these two nodes split into three Similarly when a node underflows it is combined with its two siblings and the total reduced to two nodes Thus the nodes are always at least two thirds full 1 Finally here is an example of building a B Tree of order five You can compare this to the example above of building a tree of order four with the same records5 F10 S44 Q48 E67 A88 B58 A60 F12 V27 T N N N B B
