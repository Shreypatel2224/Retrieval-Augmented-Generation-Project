n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥ h Finally we see that for AVL trees of height h with the minimum number of nodes the height is no more than 2 log2n where n is the number of nodes in the tree For AVL trees with more than the minimum number of nodes the relationship between the number of nodes and the height is even better though for reasons weve seen previously we know that the relationship between the number of nodes and the height of a binary tree can never be better than logarithmic So ultimately we see that the height of an AVL tree with n nodes is Θlog n In reality it turns out that the bound is lower than 2 log2n its something more akin to about 144 log2n even for AVL trees with the minimum number of nodes though the proof of that is more involved and doesnt change the asymptotic result31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 77
