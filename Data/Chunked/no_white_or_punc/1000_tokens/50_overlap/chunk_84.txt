keys in nodes because the subtrees T1 T2 and T3 maintain the appropriate positions relative to the keys A and B All keys in T1 are smaller than A All keys in T2 are larger than A and smaller than B All keys in T3 are larger than B Performing this rotation would be a simple matter of adjusting a few pointers — notably a constant number of pointers no matter how many nodes are in the tree which means that this rotation would run in Θ1 time Bs parent would now point to A where it used to point to B As right child would now be B instead of the root of T2 Bs left child would now be the root of T2 instead of A A second kind of rotation is an RR rotation which makes a similar adjustment Note that an RR rotation is the mirror image of an LL rotation31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 47A third kind of rotation is an LR rotation which makes an adjustment thats slightly more complicated An LR rotation requires five pointer
