even without input Changes could be the result of eventual consistency  Data stores don’t have to be writeconsistent  Replicas don’t have to be mutually consistent  Eventual Consistency  The system will eventually become consistent  All writes will eventually stop so all nodesreplicas can be updated Categories of NoSQL DBs  Review KeyValue Databases KeyValue Stores  Key  Value  Designed around  Simplicity The data model is extremely simple Comparatively tables in an RDBMS are very complex Lends itself to simple CRUD operations and API creation  Speed Usually deployed as inmemory DB Retrieving a value given its key is typically an O1 operation because hash tables or similar data structures are used under the hood No concept of complex queries or joins—they slow things down  Scalability Horizontal scaling is simple—add more nodes Typically concerned with eventual consistency meaning in a distributed environment the only guarantee is that all nodes will eventually converge on the same
