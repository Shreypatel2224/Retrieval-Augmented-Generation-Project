failing between two segments of the distributed system  Note The definition of Consistency in CAP is different from that of ACID CAP Theorem Review Continued  Consistency  Availability  System always responds with the latest data and every request gets a response but it may not be able to deal with network partitions  Consistency  Partition Tolerance  If the system responds with data from the distributed system it is always the latest otherwise the data request is dropped  Availability  Partition Tolerance  System always sends and responds based on the distributed store but the data may not be the absolute latest ACID Alternative for Distributed Systems  BASE  Basically Available  Guarantees the availability of the data per CAP but the response can be “failure”“unreliable” because the data is in an inconsistent or changing state  The system appears to work most of the time  Soft State  The state of the system could change over time even without input Changes could be the result of
