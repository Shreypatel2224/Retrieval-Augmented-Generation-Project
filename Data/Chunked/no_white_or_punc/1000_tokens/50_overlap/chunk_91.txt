tree with n nodes Optional The answer revolves around noting how many nodes at minimum could be in a binary search tree of height n and still have it be an AVL tree It turns out AVL trees of height n ≥ 2 that have the minimum number of nodes in them all share a similar property The AVL tree with height h ≥ 2 with the minimum number of nodes consists of a root node with two subtrees one of which is an AVL tree with height h − 1 with the minimum number of nodes the other of which is an AVL tree with height h − 2 with the minimum number of nodes Given that observation we can write a recurrence that describes the number of nodes at minimum in an AVL tree of height h M0  1 When height is 0 minimum number of nodes is 1 a root node with no children M1  2 When height is 1 minimum number of nodes is 2 a root node with one child and not the other Mh  1  Mh  1  Mh  2 While the repeated substitution technique we learned previously isnt a good way to try to solve this particular recurrence we can
