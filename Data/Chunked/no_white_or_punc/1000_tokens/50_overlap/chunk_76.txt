is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h − 2 That can be a bit of a mindbending definition but it actually leads to a conceptually simple result On every level of a complete binary tree every node that could possibly be present will be except the last level might be missing nodes but if it is missing nodes the nodes that are there will be as far to the left as possible The following are all complete binary trees Furthermore these are the only possible complete binary trees with these numbers of nodes in them any other arrangement of say 6 keys besides the one shown above would violate the definition Weve seen that the height of a perfect binary tree is Θlog n Its not a stretch to see that the height a complete binary tree will be Θlog n as well and well accept that via our intuition for now and proceed All in all a complete binary tree would be a great goal for us to attain If we could keep the shape of our binary search
