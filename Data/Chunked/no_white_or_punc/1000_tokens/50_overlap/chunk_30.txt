find the appropriate leaf node into which the inserted element falls assuming it is not already in the tree If there is already room in the node the new element can be inserted simply Otherwise the current leaf is already full and must be split into two leaves one of which acquires the new element The parent is then updated to contain a new key and child pointer If the parent is already full the process ripples upwards eventually possibly reaching the root If the root is split into two then a new root is created with just two children increasing the height of the tree by one For example here is the effect of a series of insertions The first insertion 13 merely affects a leaf The second insertion 14 overflows the leaf and adds a key to an internal node The third insertion propagates all the way to the root Deletion works in the opposite way the element is removed from the leaf If the leaf becomes empty a key is removed from the parent node If that breaks invariant 3 the keys of the
