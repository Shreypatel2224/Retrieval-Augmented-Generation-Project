Depending on the size of a record as compared to the size of a key a leaf node in a tree of order might have enough room to store more or less than records The requirement is simply that the leaf nodes store enough records to remain at least half full The leaf nodes of a tree are normally linked together to form a doubly linked list Thus the entire collection of records can be traversed in sorted order by visiting all the leaf nodes on the linked list Here is a Javalike pseudocode representation for the tree node interface Leaf node and internal node subclasses would implement this interface  Interface for B Tree nodes  public interface BPNodeKeyE  public boolean isLeaf public int numrecs public Key keys  An important implementation detail to note is that while Figure 1261 shows internal nodes containing three keys and four pointers class BPNode is slightly different in that it stores keypointer pairs Figure 1261 shows the tree as it is traditionally drawn To simplify implementation
