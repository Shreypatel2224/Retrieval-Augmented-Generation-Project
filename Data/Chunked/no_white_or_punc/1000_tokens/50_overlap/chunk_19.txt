nodes with 100 full children each A tree with height four must have at least 250000 records and at most 100 million records Thus it would require an extremely large database to generate a tree of more than height four The tree split and insert rules guarantee that every node except perhaps the root is at least half full So they are on average about 34 full But the internal nodes are purely overhead since the keys stored there are used only by the tree to direct search rather than store actual data Does this overhead amount to a significant use of space No because once again the high fanout rate of the tree structure means that the vast majority of nodes are leaf nodes A Kary tree has approximately of its nodes as internal nodes This means that while half of a full binary treeâ€™s nodes are internal nodes in a tree of order 100 probably only about of its nodes are internal nodes This means that the overhead associated with internal nodes is very low We can reduce the number of disk
