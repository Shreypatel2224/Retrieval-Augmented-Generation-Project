the essential ordering property of a binary search tree smaller keys toward the left larger ones toward the right Rotations Rebalancing of AVL trees is achieved using what are called rotations which when used at the proper times efficiently improve the shape of the tree by altering a handful of pointers There are a few kinds of rotations we should first understand how they work then focus our attention on when to use them The first kind of rotation is called an LL rotation which takes the tree on the left and turns it into the tree on the right The circle with A and B written in them are each a single node containing a single key the triangles with T1 T2 and T3 written in them are arbitrary subtrees which may be empty or may contain any number of nodes but which are themselves binary search trees Its important to remember that both of these trees — before and after — are binary search trees the rotation doesnt harm the ordering of the keys in nodes because the subtrees T1 T2 and T3
