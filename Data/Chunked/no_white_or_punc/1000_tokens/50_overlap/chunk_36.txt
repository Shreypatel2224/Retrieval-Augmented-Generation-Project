practical and financial limits  However Modern systems make horizontal scaling less problematic Distributed Systems  A distributed system is “a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as one computer”  Andrew Tannenbaum  Characteristics of Distributed Systems  Computers operate concurrently  Computers fail independently  No shared global clock Distributed Storage  Distributed Data Stores  Data is stored on more than one node typically replicated  Each block of data is available on N nodes  Distributed databases can be relational or nonrelational  MySQL and PostgreSQL support replication and sharding  CockroachDB is a new player on the scene  Many NoSQL systems support one or both models  Network partitioning is inevitable  Network failures system failures  Overall system needs to be Partition Tolerant  The system can keep running even with a network partition The CAP Theorem  The CAP Theorem states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to
