of whether weve found what were looking for A compromise AVL trees There are a few wellknown approaches for maintaining binary search trees in a state of nearbalance that meets our notion of a good balance condition One of them is called an AVL tree which well explore here Others which are outside the scope of this course include redblack trees which meet our definition of good and splay trees which dont always meet our definition of good but do meet it on an amortized basis but well stick with the one solution to the problem for now AVL trees AVL trees are what you might called nearly balanced binary search trees While they certainly arent as perfectlybalanced as possible they nonetheless achieve the goals weve decided on maintaining logarithmic height at no more than logarithmic cost So what makes a binary search tree nearly balanced enough to be considered an AVL tree The core concept is embodied by something called the AVL property We say that a node in a binary search tree has
