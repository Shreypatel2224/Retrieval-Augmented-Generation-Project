We say that a node in a binary search tree has the AVL property if the heights of its left and right subtrees dif fer by no more than 1 In other words we tolerate a certain amount of imbalance — heights of subtrees can be slightly different but no more than that — in hopes that we can more efficiently maintain it Since were going to be comparing heights of subtrees theres one piece of background we need to consider Recall that the height of a tree is the length of its longest path By definition the height of a tree with just a root node and empty subtrees would then be zero But what about a tree thats totally empty To maintain a clear pattern relative to other tree heights well say that the height of an empty tree is 1 This means that a node with say a childless left child and no right child would still be considered balanced This leads us finally to the definition of an AVL tree An AVL tree is a binary search tree in which all nodes have the AVL property  Below are a few binary trees
