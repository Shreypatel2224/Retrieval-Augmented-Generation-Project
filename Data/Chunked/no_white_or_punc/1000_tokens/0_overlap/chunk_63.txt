data space inefficient Solutions  External Data Structures  Use an array of tuples specialVal rowNumber sorted by specialVal  Enables binary search for faster retrieval  Slow for inserts like inserting into a sorted array  Use a linked list of tuples specialVal rowNumber sorted by specialVal  Fast for inserts  Slow for searching requires linear scan Binary Search Trees BST Overview  A binary tree where  Every node in the left subtree is less than its parent  Every node in the right subtree is greater than its parent  Advantages  Fast insert and fast search operations Time Complexity Summary Linear Search  Worst case On Binary Search  Worst case Olog₂n Binary Search Tree BST  Search Olog₂n on average On in the worst case for an unbalanced tree  Insert Olog₂n on average On in the worst case for an unbalanced tree Observations  Arrays  Fast for random access  Slow for random insertions  Linked Lists  Slow for random access  Fast for random insertions  Binary Search Trees  Balance is key
