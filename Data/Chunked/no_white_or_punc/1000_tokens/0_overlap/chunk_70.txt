shapes represent the two extremes — the best and worst possible shapes for a binary search tree containing seven keys Of course when all you have is a very small number of keys like this any shape will do But as the number of keys grows the distinction between these two tree shapes becomes increasingly vital Whats more the degenerate shape isnt even necessarily a rare edge case Its what you get when you start with an empty tree and add keys that are already in order which is a surprisingly common scenario in realworld programs For example one very obvious algorithm for generating unique integer keys — when all you care about is that theyre unique — is to generate them sequentially Whats so bad about a degenerate tree anyway Just looking at a picture of a degenerate tree your intuition should already be telling you that something is amiss In particular if you tilt your head 45 degrees to the right they look just like linked lists that perception is no accident as they behave like them
