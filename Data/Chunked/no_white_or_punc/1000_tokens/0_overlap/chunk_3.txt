containing the child node usually interpreted as an offset from the beginning of the corresponding disk file In a typical application the Btree’s access to the disk file will be managed using a buffer pool and a blockreplacement scheme such as LRU Figure 1261 shows a Btree of order four Each node contains up to three keys and internal nodes have up to four children Figure 1261 A Btree of order four Search in a Btree is a generalization of search in a 23 tree It is an alternating twostep process beginning with the root node of the B tree 1 Perform a binary search on the records in the current node If a record with the search key is found then return that record If the current node is a leaf node and the key is not found then report an unsuccessful searchm ⌈m2⌉ m 24 1520 334548 1012 18 2123 3030 38 47 50526031425 441 PM 126 BTrees — CS3 Data Structures  Algorithms httpsopendsaservercsvteduODSABooksCS3htmlBTreehtmlid2 192 Otherwise follow the proper branch and repeat the process For
