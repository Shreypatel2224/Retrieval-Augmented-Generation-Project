control the trees shape more carefully to force it to remain more balanced well be fine The question of course is how to do it and as importantly whether we can do it while keeping the cost low enough that it doesnt outweigh the benefit Aiming for perfection The best goal for us to shoot for would be to maintain perfection In other words every time we insert a key into our binary search tree it would ideally still be a perfect binary tree in which case wed know that the height of the tree would always be Î˜log n with a commensurate effect on performance However when we consider this goal a problem emerges almost immediately The following are all perfect binary trees by definition The perfect binary trees pictured above have 1 3 7 and 15 nodes respectively and are the only possible perfect shapes for binary trees with that number of nodes The problem though lies in the fact that there is no valid perfect binary tree with 2 nodes or with 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14 nodes So generally its
