lookup terminates without the key being found add a new node in the appropriate leaf position where the lookup ended The problem is that adding the new node introduced the possibility of an imbalance For example suppose we started with this AVL tree and then we inserted the key 35 into it A binary search tree insertion would give us this as a result 31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 57But this resulting tree is not an AVL tree because the node containing the key 40 does not have the AVL property because the difference in the heights of its subtrees is 2 Its left subtree has height 1 its right subtree — which is empty — has height 1 What can we do about it The answer lies in the following algorithm which we perform after the normal insertion process Work your way back up the tree from the position where you just added a node This could be quite simple if the insertion was done recursively Compare the heights of the
