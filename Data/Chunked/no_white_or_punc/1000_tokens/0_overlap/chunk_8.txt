collection of records can be traversed in sorted order by visiting all the leaf nodes on the linked list Here is a Javalike pseudocode representation for the tree node interface Leaf node and internal node subclasses would implement this interface  Interface for B Tree nodes  public interface BPNodeKeyE  public boolean isLeaf public int numrecs public Key keys  An important implementation detail to note is that while Figure 1261 shows internal nodes containing three keys and four pointers class BPNode is slightly different in that it stores keypointer pairs Figure 1261 shows the tree as it is traditionally drawn To simplify implementation in practice nodes really do associate a key with each pointer Each internal node should be assumed to hold in theBB∗ BB BB BB Bm m B B B31425 441 PM 126 BTrees — CS3 Data Structures  Algorithms httpsopendsaservercsvteduODSABooksCS3htmlBTreehtmlid2 29leftmost position an additional key that is less than or equal to any possible key value in the node’s
