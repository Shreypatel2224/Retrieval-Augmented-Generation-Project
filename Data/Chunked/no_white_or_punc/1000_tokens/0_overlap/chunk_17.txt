and merge routines This gave better performance than the 2for3 node split and merge routines of the tree However the spitting and merging routines were so complicated that even their author could no longer understand them once they were completed 12612 BTree Analysis The asymptotic cost of search insertion and deletion of records from Btrees trees and trees is where is the total number of records in the tree However the base of the log is the average branching factor of the tree Typical database applications use extremely high branching factors perhaps 100 or more Thus in practice the Btree and its variants are extremely shallow As an illustration consider a tree of order 100 and leaf nodes that contain up to 100 records A B tree with height one that is just a single leaf node can have at most 100 records A tree with height two a root internal node whose children are leaves must have at least 100 records 2 leaves with 50 records each It has at most 10000 records 100 leaves with 100
