is combined with its two siblings and the total reduced to two nodes Thus the nodes are always at least two thirds full 1 Finally here is an example of building a B Tree of order five You can compare this to the example above of building a tree of order four with the same records5 F10 S44 Q48 E67 A88 B58 A60 F12 V27 T N N N B B BB∗B∗B B∗ 1  33     Example B Tree V isualization Insert into a tree of degree 531425 441 PM 126 BTrees — CS3 Data Structures  Algorithms httpsopendsaservercsvteduODSABooksCS3htmlBTreehtmlid2 79Figure 1268 An example of building a B tree of degree 5 Click here for a visualization that will let you construct and interact with a tree This visualization was written by David Galles of the University of San Francisco as part of his Data Structure Visualizations package 1 This concept can be extended further if higher space utilization is required However the update routines become much more complicated I once worked on a project where we implemented 3for4 node split
