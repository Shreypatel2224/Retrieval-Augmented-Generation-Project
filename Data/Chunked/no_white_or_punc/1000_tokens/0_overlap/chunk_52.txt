created to be proximal to users but now we have to route requests to distant leaders when reading modifiable data Monotonic Read Consistency  Monotonic read anomalies Occur when a user reads values out of order from multiple followers  Monotonic read consistency Ensures that when a user makes multiple reads they will not read older data after previously reading newer data Consistent Prefix Reads  Reading data out of order can occur if different partitions replicate data at different rates There is no global write consistency  Consistent Prefix Read Guarantee Ensures that if a sequence of writes happens in a certain order anyone reading those writes will see them appear in the same order
