example consider a search for the record with key value 47 in the tree of Figure 1261 The root node is examined and the second right branch taken After examining the node at level 1 the third branch is taken to the next level to arrive at the leaf node containing a record with key value 47 Btree insertion is a generalization of 23 tree insertion The first step is to find the leaf node that should contain the key to be inserted space permitting If there is room in this node then insert the key If there is not then split the node into two and promote the middle key to the parent If the parent becomes full then it is split in turn and its middle key promoted Note that this insertion process is guaranteed to keep all nodes at least half full For example when we attempt to insert into a full internal node of a Btree of order four there will now be five children that must be dealt with The node is split into two nodes containing two keys each thus retaining the Btree property The middle of
