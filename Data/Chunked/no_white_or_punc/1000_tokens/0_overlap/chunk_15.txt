merge if necessary return BPInternalKeyErtunderflowcurrec  else  return false    The tree requires that all nodes be at least half full except for the root Thus the storage utilization must be at least 50 This is satisfactory for many implementations but note that keeping nodes fuller will result both in less space required because there is less empty space in the disk file and in more efficient processing fewer blocks on average will be read into memory because the amount of information in each block is greater Because Btrees have become so popular many algorithm designers have tried to improve Btree performance One method for doing so is to use the tree variant known as the tree The tree is identical to the tree except for the rules used to split and merge nodes Instead of splitting a node in half when it overflows the tree gives some records to its neighboring sibling if possible If the sibling is also full then these two nodes split into three Similarly when a node underflows it
