n then we can be certain that lookups insertions and removals will take Olog n time How can we be so sure Lookups would be Olog n because theyre the same as they are in a binary search tree that doesnt have the AVL property If the height of the tree is Θlog n lookups will run in Olog n time Insertions and removals despite being slightly more complicated in an AVL tree do their work by traversing a single path in the tree — potentially all the way down to a leaf position then all the way back up If the length of the longest path —31425 439 PM ICS 46 Spring 2022 Notes and Examples AVL Trees httpsicsucieduthorntonics46NotesAVLTrees 67thats what the height of a tree is — is Θlog n then we know that none of these paths is longer than that so insertions and removals will take Olog n time So were left with that key question What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes If youre not curious you can feel free to just assume this if you want to know more keep reading What is the height of an
