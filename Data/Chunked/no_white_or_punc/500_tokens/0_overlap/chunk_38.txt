four then at most two disk fetches internal nodes at level two and leaves at level three are required to reach the pointer to any given record A buffer pool could be used to manage nodes of the Btree Several nodes of the tree would typically be in main memory at one time The most straightforward approach is to use a standard method such as LRU to do node replacement However sometimes it might be desirable to “lock” certain nodes such as the root into the buffer pool In general if the buffer
