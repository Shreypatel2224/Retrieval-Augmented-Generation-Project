good way to try to solve this particular recurrence we can prove something interesting quite easily We know for sure that AVL trees with larger heights have a bigger minimum number of nodes than AVL trees with smaller heights — thats fairly selfexplanatory — which means that we can be sure that 1  Mh − 1 ≥ Mh − 2 Given that we can conclude the following Mh ≥ 2Mh  2 We can then use the repeated substitution technique to determine a lower bound for this recurrence Mh ≥ 2Mh  2 ≥ 22Mh  4 ≥ 4Mh  4 ≥
