keys in T1 are smaller than A All keys in T2 are larger than A and smaller than B All keys in T3 are larger than B Performing this rotation would be a simple matter of adjusting a few pointers — notably a constant number of pointers no matter how many nodes are in the tree which means that this rotation would run in Θ1 time Bs parent would now point to A where it used to point to B As right child would now be B instead of the root of T2 Bs left child would now be the root of T2 instead of A A
