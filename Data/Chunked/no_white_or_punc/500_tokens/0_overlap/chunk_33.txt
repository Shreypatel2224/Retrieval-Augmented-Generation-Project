we implemented 3for4 node split and merge routines This gave better performance than the 2for3 node split and merge routines of the tree However the spitting and merging routines were so complicated that even their author could no longer understand them once they were completed 12612 BTree Analysis The asymptotic cost of search insertion and deletion of records from Btrees trees and trees is where is the total number of records in the tree However the base of the log is the average branching
