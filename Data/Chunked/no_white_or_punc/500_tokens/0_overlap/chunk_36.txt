except perhaps the root is at least half full So they are on average about 34 full But the internal nodes are purely overhead since the keys stored there are used only by the tree to direct search rather than store actual data Does this overhead amount to a significant use of space No because once again the high fanout rate of the tree structure means that the vast majority of nodes are leaf nodes A Kary tree has approximately of its nodes as internal nodes This means that while half of a full
