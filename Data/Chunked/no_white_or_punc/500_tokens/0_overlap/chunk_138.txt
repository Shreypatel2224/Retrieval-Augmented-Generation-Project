could think of this as taking a single step creating the node The second key you add will require you to look at the root node then take one step to the right You could think of this as taking two steps Each subsequent key you add will require one more step than the one before it The total number of steps it would take to add n keys would be determined by the sum 1  2  3    n This sum which well see several times throughout this course is equal to nn  1  2 So the total number of steps to build
