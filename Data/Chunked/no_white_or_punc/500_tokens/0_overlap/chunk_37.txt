binary treeâ€™s nodes are internal nodes in a tree of order 100 probably only about of its nodes are internal nodes This means that the overhead associated with internal nodes is very low We can reduce the number of disk fetches required for the Btree even more by using the following methods First the upper levels of the tree can be stored in main memory at all times Because the tree branches so quickly the top two levels levels 0 and 1 require relatively little space If the Btree is only height
