recursively Compare the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node When they differ by more than 1 choose a rotation that will fix the imbalance Note that comparing the heights of the left and right subtrees would be quite expensive if you didnt already know what they were The solution to this problem is for each node to store its height ie the height of the subtree rooted there This can be cheaply updated after every insertion or removal as you unwind the recursion The rotation is
