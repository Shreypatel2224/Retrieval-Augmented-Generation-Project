is essentially a mechanism for managing a sorted arraybased list where the list is broken into chunks The most significant difference between the tree and the BST or the standard Btree is that the tree stores records only at the leaf nodes Internal nodes store key values but these are used solely as placeholders to guide the search This means that internal nodes are significantly different in structure from leaf nodes Internal nodes store keys to guide the search associating each key with a
