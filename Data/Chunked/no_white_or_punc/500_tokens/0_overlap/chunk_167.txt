Compare this to the diagram describing an LR rotation The node containing 40 is C The node containing 30 is A The node containing 35 is B The empty left subtree of the node containing 30 is T1 The empty left subtree of the node containing 35 is T2 The empty right subtree of the node containing 35 is T3 The empty right subtree of the node containing 40 is T4 After the rotation we see what wed expect The node B which in our example contained 35 is now the root of the newlyrotated subtree The node
