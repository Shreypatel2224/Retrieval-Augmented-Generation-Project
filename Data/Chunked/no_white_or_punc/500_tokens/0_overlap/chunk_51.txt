were first introduced A Btree of order m is a search tree in which each nonleaf node has up to m children The actual elements of the collection are stored in the leaves of the tree and the nonleaf nodes contain only keys Each leaf stores some number of elements the maximum number may be greater or typically less than m The data structure satisfies several invariants 1 Every path from the root to a leaf has the same length 2 If a node has n children it contains nâˆ’1 keys 3 Every node except the
