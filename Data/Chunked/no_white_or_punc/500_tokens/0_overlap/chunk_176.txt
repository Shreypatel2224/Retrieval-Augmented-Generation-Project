h Finally we see that for AVL trees of height h with the minimum number of nodes the height is no more than 2 log2n where n is the number of nodes in the tree For AVL trees with more than the minimum number of nodes the relationship between the number of nodes and the height is even better though for reasons weve seen previously we know that the relationship between the number of nodes and the height of a binary tree can never be better than logarithmic So ultimately we see that the height of
