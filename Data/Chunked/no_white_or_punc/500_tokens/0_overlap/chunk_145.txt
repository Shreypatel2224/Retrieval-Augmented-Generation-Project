height a complete binary tree will be Θlog n as well and well accept that via our intuition for now and proceed All in all a complete binary tree would be a great goal for us to attain If we could keep the shape of our binary search trees complete we would always have binary search trees with height Θlog n The cost of maintaining completeness The trouble of course is that we need an algorithm for maintaining completeness And before we go to the trouble of trying to figure one out we should
