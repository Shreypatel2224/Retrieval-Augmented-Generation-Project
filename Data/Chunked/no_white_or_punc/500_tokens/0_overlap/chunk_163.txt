this resulting tree is not an AVL tree because the node containing the key 40 does not have the AVL property because the difference in the heights of its subtrees is 2 Its left subtree has height 1 its right subtree — which is empty — has height 1 What can we do about it The answer lies in the following algorithm which we perform after the normal insertion process Work your way back up the tree from the position where you just added a node This could be quite simple if the insertion was done
