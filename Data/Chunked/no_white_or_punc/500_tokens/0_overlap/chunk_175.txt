42Mh  6 ≥ 8Mh  6  ≥ 2jMh  2j We could prove this by induction on j but well accept it on faith let j  h2 ≥ 2h2Mh  h ≥ 2h2M0 Mh ≥ 2h2 So weve shown that the minimum number of nodes that can be present in an AVL tree of height h is at least 2h2 In reality its actually more than that but this gives us something useful to work with we can use this result to figure out what were really interested in which is the opposite what is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥
