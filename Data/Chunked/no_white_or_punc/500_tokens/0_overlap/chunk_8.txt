node then insert the key If there is not then split the node into two and promote the middle key to the parent If the parent becomes full then it is split in turn and its middle key promoted Note that this insertion process is guaranteed to keep all nodes at least half full For example when we attempt to insert into a full internal node of a Btree of order four there will now be five children that must be dealt with The node is split into two nodes containing two keys each thus retaining the
