children Each internal node except for the root has between and children All leaves are at the same level in the tree so the tree is always height balanced The Btree is a generalization of the 23 tree Put another way a 23 tree is a Btree of order three Normally the size of a node in the B tree is chosen to fill a disk block A Btree node implementation typically allows 100 or more children Thus a Btree node is equivalent to a disk block and a “pointer” value stored in the tree is actually the
