and B written in them are each a single node containing a single key the triangles with T1 T2 and T3 written in them are arbitrary subtrees which may be empty or may contain any number of nodes but which are themselves binary search trees Its important to remember that both of these trees — before and after — are binary search trees the rotation doesnt harm the ordering of the keys in nodes because the subtrees T1 T2 and T3 maintain the appropriate positions relative to the keys A and B All
