definition and the two trees above that dont meet that definition fail to meet it because they each have at least one node marked in the diagrams by a dashed square that doesnt have the AVL property AVL trees by definition are required to meet the balance condition after every operation every time you insert or remove a key every node in the tree should have the AVL property To meet that requirement we need to restructure the tree periodically essentially detecting and correcting imbalance
