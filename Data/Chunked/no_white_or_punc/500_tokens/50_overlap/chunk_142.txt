to strengthen or break apart Centrality  Measures the importance of nodes in a graph eg degree centrality betweenness centrality etc Some Famous Graph Algorithms  Dijkstra’s Algorithm Singlesource shortest path algorithm for positively weighted graphs  A Algorithm Similar to Dijkstra’s with added feature of using a heuristic to guide traversal  PageRank Measures the importance of each node within a graph based on the number of incoming relationships and the importance of the nodes from those
