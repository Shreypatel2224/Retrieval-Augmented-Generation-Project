of nodes is 2 a root node with one child and not the other Mh  1  Mh  1  Mh  2 While the repeated substitution technique we learned previously isnt a good way to try to solve this particular recurrence we can prove something interesting quite easily We know for sure that AVL trees with larger heights have a bigger minimum number of nodes than AVL trees with smaller heights — thats fairly selfexplanatory — which means that we can be sure that 1  Mh − 1 ≥ Mh − 2 Given that we can conclude the
