is the mirror image of an LR rotation Once we understand the mechanics of how rotations work were one step closer to understanding AVL trees But these rotations arent arbitrary theyre used specifically to correct imbalances that are detected after insertions or removals An insertion algorithm Inserting a key into an AVL tree starts out the same way as insertion into a binary search tree Perform a lookup If you find the key already in the tree youre done because keys in a binary search tree must
