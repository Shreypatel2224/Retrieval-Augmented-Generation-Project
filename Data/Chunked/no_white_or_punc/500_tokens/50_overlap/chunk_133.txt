a specific id is fast  Searching for a specific specialVal requires a linear scan of the column  Problem  Data cannot be stored on disk sorted by both id and specialVal simultaneously without duplicating data space inefficient Solutions  External Data Structures  Use an array of tuples specialVal rowNumber sorted by specialVal  Enables binary search for faster retrieval  Slow for inserts like inserting into a sorted array  Use a linked list of tuples specialVal rowNumber sorted by specialVal
