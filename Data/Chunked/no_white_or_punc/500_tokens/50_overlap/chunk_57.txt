the leaves have enough space to store up to 3 data records Because the height of the tree is uniformly the same and every node is at least half full we are guaranteed that the asymptotic performance is Olg n where n is the size of the collection The real win is in the constant factors of course We can choose m so that the pointers to the m children plus the mâˆ’1 elements fill out a cache line at the highest level of the memory hierarchy where we can expect to get cache hits For example if we are
