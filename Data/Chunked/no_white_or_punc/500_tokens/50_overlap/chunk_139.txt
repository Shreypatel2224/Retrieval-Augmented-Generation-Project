There is a path between any two nodes in the graph  Weighted vs Unweighted Edges have a weight property important for some algorithms  Directed vs Undirected Relationships edges define a start and end node  Acyclic vs Cyclic Graph contains no cycles  Sparse vs Dense Few vs many edges relative to the number of nodes  Trees A type of graph with no cycles and a hierarchical structure Types of Graph Algorithms  Pathfinding  Pathfinding  Finding the shortest path between two nodes if one exists is
