shortest path between two nodes if one exists is probably the most common operation  “Shortest” means fewest edges or lowest weight  Average Shortest Path can be used to monitor efficiency and resiliency of networks  Minimum spanning tree cycle detection maxmin flow… are other types of pathfinding BFS vs DFS  BreadthFirst Search BFS Explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level  DepthFirst Search DFS Explores as far as possible along each branch
