we used we would still have to move every key If there are n keys in the tree that would take Ωn time — moving n keys takes at least linear time even if you have the best possible algorithm for moving them the work still has to get done So in the worst case maintaining completeness after a single insertion requires Ωn time Unfortunately this is more time than we ought to be spending on maintaining balance This means well need to come up with a compromise as is often the case when we learn or
