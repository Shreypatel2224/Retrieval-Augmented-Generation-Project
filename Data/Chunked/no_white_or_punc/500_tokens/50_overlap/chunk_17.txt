would implement this interface  Interface for B Tree nodes  public interface BPNodeKeyE  public boolean isLeaf public int numrecs public Key keys  An important implementation detail to note is that while Figure 1261 shows internal nodes containing three keys and four pointers class BPNode is slightly different in that it stores keypointer pairs Figure 1261 shows the tree as it is traditionally drawn To simplify implementation in practice nodes really do associate a key with each pointer Each
