BTrees The idea we saw earlier of putting multiple set list hash table elements together into large chunks that exploit locality can also be applied to trees Binary search trees are not good for locality because a given node of the binary tree probably occupies only a fraction of any cache line Btrees are a way to get better locality by putting multiple elements into each tree node Btrees were originally invented for storing data structures on disk where locality is even more crucial than with
