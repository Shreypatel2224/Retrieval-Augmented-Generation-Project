The fewer the number of disk blocks affected during an operation the less disk IO is required 3 Btrees keep related records that is records with similar key values on the same disk block which helps to minimize disk IO on range searches 4 Btrees guarantee that every node in the tree will be full at least to a certain minimum percentage This improves space efficiency while reducing the typical number of disk fetches necessary during a search or update operation A Btree of order is defined to
