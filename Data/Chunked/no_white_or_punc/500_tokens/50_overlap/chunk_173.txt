or may contain any number of nodes but which are themselves binary search trees Its important to remember that both of these trees — before and after — are binary search trees the rotation doesnt harm the ordering of the keys in nodes because the subtrees T1 T2 and T3 maintain the appropriate positions relative to the keys A and B All keys in T1 are smaller than A All keys in T2 are larger than A and smaller than B All keys in T3 are larger than B Performing this rotation would be a simple
