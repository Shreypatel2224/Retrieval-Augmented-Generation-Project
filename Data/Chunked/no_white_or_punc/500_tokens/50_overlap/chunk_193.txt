minimum number of nodes the relationship between the number of nodes and the height is even better though for reasons weve seen previously we know that the relationship between the number of nodes and the height of a binary tree can never be better than logarithmic So ultimately we see that the height of an AVL tree with n nodes is Î˜log n In reality it turns out that the bound is lower than 2 log2n its something more akin to about 144 log2n even for AVL trees with the minimum number of nodes
