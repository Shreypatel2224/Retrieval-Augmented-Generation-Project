BTree Analysis The asymptotic cost of search insertion and deletion of records from Btrees trees and trees is where is the total number of records in the tree However the base of the log is the average branching factor of the tree Typical database applications use extremely high branching factors perhaps 100 or more Thus in practice the Btree and its variants are extremely shallow As an illustration consider a tree of order 100 and leaf nodes that contain up to 100 records A B tree with height
