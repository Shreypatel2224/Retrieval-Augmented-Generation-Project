as taking two steps Each subsequent key you add will require one more step than the one before it The total number of steps it would take to add n keys would be determined by the sum 1  2  3    n This sum which well see several times throughout this course is equal to nn  1  2 So the total number of steps to build the entire tree would be Î˜n2 Overall when n gets large the tree would be hideously expensive to build and then every subsequent search would be painful as well So this in general is a
