you would start with the usual binary search tree removal algorithm then find and correct imbalances while the recursion unwinds The key difference is that removals can require more than one rotation to correct imbalances but will still only require rotations on the path back up to the root from where the removal occurred — so generally Olog n rotations Asymptotic analysis The key question here is What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes If the answer is Θlog n then we can be certain that
