A complete binary tree of height h is a binary tree where If h  0 its left and right subtrees are empty  If h  0 one of two things is true The left subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 The left subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h − 2 That can be a bit of a mindbending definition but it actually leads to a conceptually simple result On every level
