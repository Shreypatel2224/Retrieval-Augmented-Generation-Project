records 100 secondlevel nodes with 100 full children each A tree with height four must have at least 250000 records and at most 100 million records Thus it would require an extremely large database to generate a tree of more than height four The tree split and insert rules guarantee that every node except perhaps the root is at least half full So they are on average about 34 full But the internal nodes are purely overhead since the keys stored there are used only by the tree to direct search
