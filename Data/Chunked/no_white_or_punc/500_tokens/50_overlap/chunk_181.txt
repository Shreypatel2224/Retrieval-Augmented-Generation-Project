the left perform an LL rotation rooted where the imbalance is If the two links are both to the right perform an RR rotation rooted where the imbalance is If the first link is to the left and the second is to the right perform an LR rotation rooted where the imbalance is If the first link is to the right and the second is to the left perform an RL rotation rooted where the imbalance is It can be shown that any one of these rotations — LL RR LR or RL — will correct any imbalance brought on by
