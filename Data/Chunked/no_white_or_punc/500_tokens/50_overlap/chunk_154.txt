effect on performance However when we consider this goal a problem emerges almost immediately The following are all perfect binary trees by definition The perfect binary trees pictured above have 1 3 7 and 15 nodes respectively and are the only possible perfect shapes for binary trees with that number of nodes The problem though lies in the fact that there is no valid perfect binary tree with 2 nodes or with 4 5 6 8 9 10 11 12 13 or 14 nodes So generally its impossible for us to guarantee that
