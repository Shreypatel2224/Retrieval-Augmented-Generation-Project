search tree Perform a lookup If you find the key already in the tree youre done because keys in a binary search tree must be unique When the lookup terminates without the key being found add a new node in the appropriate leaf position where the lookup ended The problem is that adding the new node introduced the possibility of an imbalance For example suppose we started with this AVL tree and then we inserted the key 35 into it A binary search tree insertion would give us this as a result 31425
