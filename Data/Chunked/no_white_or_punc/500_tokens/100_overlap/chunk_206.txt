so generally Olog n rotations Asymptotic analysis The key question here is What is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes If the answer is Θlog n then we can be certain that lookups insertions and removals will take Olog n time How can we be so sure Lookups would be Olog n because theyre the same as they are in a binary search tree that doesnt have the AVL property If the height of the tree is Θlog n lookups will run in Olog n time Insertions and removals despite being slightly more complicated
