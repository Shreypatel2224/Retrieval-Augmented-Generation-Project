the tree is always height balanced The Btree is a generalization of the 23 tree Put another way a 23 tree is a Btree of order three Normally the size of a node in the B tree is chosen to fill a disk block A Btree node implementation typically allows 100 or more children Thus a Btree node is equivalent to a disk block and a “pointer” value stored in the tree is actually the number of the block containing the child node usually interpreted as an offset from the beginning of the corresponding disk
