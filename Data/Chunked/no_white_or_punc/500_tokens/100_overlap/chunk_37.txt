in each block is greater Because Btrees have become so popular many algorithm designers have tried to improve Btree performance One method for doing so is to use the tree variant known as the tree The tree is identical to the tree except for the rules used to split and merge nodes Instead of splitting a node in half when it overflows the tree gives some records to its neighboring sibling if possible If the sibling is also full then these two nodes split into three Similarly when a node
