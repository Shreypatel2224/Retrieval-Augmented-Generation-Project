Sparse vs Dense Few vs many edges relative to the number of nodes  Trees A type of graph with no cycles and a hierarchical structure Types of Graph Algorithms  Pathfinding  Pathfinding  Finding the shortest path between two nodes if one exists is probably the most common operation  “Shortest” means fewest edges or lowest weight  Average Shortest Path can be used to monitor efficiency and resiliency of networks  Minimum spanning tree cycle detection maxmin flow… are other types of pathfinding
