by edges in which no nodes or edges are repeated  Example 1 → 2 → 6 → 5  Not a path 1 → 2 → 6 → 2 → 3 Flavors of Graphs  Connected vs Disconnected There is a path between any two nodes in the graph  Weighted vs Unweighted Edges have a weight property important for some algorithms  Directed vs Undirected Relationships edges define a start and end node  Acyclic vs Cyclic Graph contains no cycles  Sparse vs Dense Few vs many edges relative to the number of nodes  Trees A type of graph with no
