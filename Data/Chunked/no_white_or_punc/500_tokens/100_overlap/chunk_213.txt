tree of height h is at least 2h2 In reality its actually more than that but this gives us something useful to work with we can use this result to figure out what were really interested in which is the opposite what is the height of an AVL tree with n nodes Mh ≥ 2h2 log2Mh ≥ h2 2 log2Mh ≥ h Finally we see that for AVL trees of height h with the minimum number of nodes the height is no more than 2 log2n where n is the number of nodes in the tree For AVL trees with more than the minimum number of
