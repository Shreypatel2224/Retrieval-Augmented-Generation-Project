bit in the array is not important since this does not cause any extra disk accesses so long as we move data within that chunk But what if the chunk fills up the entire block that contains it We could just split it in half What if we want to delete a record We could just take the deleted record out of the chunk but we might not want a lot of nearempty chunks So we could put adjacent chunks together if they have only a small amount of data between them Or we could shuffle data between adjacent
