affect only those disk blocks on the path from the root to the leaf node containing the query record The fewer the number of disk blocks affected during an operation the less disk IO is required 3 Btrees keep related records that is records with similar key values on the same disk block which helps to minimize disk IO on range searches 4 Btrees guarantee that every node in the tree will be full at least to a certain minimum percentage This improves space efficiency while reducing the typical
