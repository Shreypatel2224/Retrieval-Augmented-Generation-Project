invented for storing data structures on disk where locality is even more crucial than with memory Accessing a disk location takes about 5ms  5000000ns Therefore if you are storing a tree on disk you want to make sure that a given disk read is as effective as possible Btrees have a high branching factor much larger than 2 which ensures that few disk reads are needed to navigate to the place where data is stored B trees may also useful for inmemory data structures because these days main memory
