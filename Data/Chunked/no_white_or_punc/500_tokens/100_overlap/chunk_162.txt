But as the number of keys grows the distinction between these two tree shapes becomes increasingly vital Whats more the degenerate shape isnt even necessarily a rare edge case Its what you get when you start with an empty tree and add keys that are already in order which is a surprisingly common scenario in realworld programs For example one very obvious algorithm for generating unique integer keys — when all you care about is that theyre unique — is to generate them sequentially Whats so bad
