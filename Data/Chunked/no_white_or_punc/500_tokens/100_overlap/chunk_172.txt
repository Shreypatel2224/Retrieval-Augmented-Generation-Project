of perfection to accommodate every possible number of keys we might want to store Complete binary trees A somewhat more relaxed notion of perfection is something called a complete binary tree which is defined as follows A complete binary tree of height h is a binary tree where If h  0 its left and right subtrees are empty  If h  0 one of two things is true The left subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 The left subtree
