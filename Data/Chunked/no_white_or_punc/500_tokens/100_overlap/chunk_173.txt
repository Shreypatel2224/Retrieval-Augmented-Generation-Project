of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 The left subtree is a complete binary tree of height h − 1 and the right subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h − 2 That can be a bit of a mindbending definition but it actually leads to a conceptually simple result On every level of a complete binary tree every node that could possibly be present will be except the last level might be missing nodes but if it is missing nodes the nodes that are there will be
