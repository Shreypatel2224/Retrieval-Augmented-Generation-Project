subtree of the node containing 35 is T2 The empty right subtree of the node containing 35 is T3 The empty right subtree of the node containing 40 is T4 After the rotation we see what wed expect The node B which in our example contained 35 is now the root of the newlyrotated subtree The node A which in our example contained 30 is now the left child of the root of the newlyrotated subtree The node C which in our example contained 40 is now the right child of the root of the newlyrotated subtree
