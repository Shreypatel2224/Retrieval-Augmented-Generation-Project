is simply that the leaf nodes store enough records to remain at least half full The leaf nodes of a tree are normally linked together to form a doubly linked list Thus the entire collection of records can be traversed in sorted order by visiting all the leaf nodes on the linked list Here is a Javalike pseudocode representation for the tree node interface Leaf node and internal node subclasses would implement this interface  Interface for B Tree nodes  public interface BPNodeKeyE  public boolean
