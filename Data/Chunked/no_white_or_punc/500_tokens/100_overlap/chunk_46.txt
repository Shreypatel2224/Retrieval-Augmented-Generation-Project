This means that the overhead associated with internal nodes is very low We can reduce the number of disk fetches required for the Btree even more by using the following methods First the upper levels of the tree can be stored in main memory at all times Because the tree branches so quickly the top two levels levels 0 and 1 require relatively little space If the Btree is only height four then at most two disk fetches internal nodes at level two and leaves at level three are required to reach the
