be using On memory too as you might end up with as many as n frames on your runtime stack — one for every recursive call There are ways to mitigate this — for example some kinds of carefullywritten recursion in some programming languages including C can avoid runtime stack growth as you recurse — but its still a sign of potential trouble The time it will take you to build the degenerate tree will also be prohibitive If you start with an empty binary search tree and add keys to it in order how
