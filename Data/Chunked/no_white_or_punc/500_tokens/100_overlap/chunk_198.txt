1 its right subtree — which is empty — has height 1 What can we do about it The answer lies in the following algorithm which we perform after the normal insertion process Work your way back up the tree from the position where you just added a node This could be quite simple if the insertion was done recursively Compare the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node When they differ by more than 1 choose a rotation that will fix the imbalance Note that comparing the heights of the left
