the other of which is an AVL tree with height h âˆ’ 2 with the minimum number of nodes Given that observation we can write a recurrence that describes the number of nodes at minimum in an AVL tree of height h M0  1 When height is 0 minimum number of nodes is 1 a root node with no children M1  2 When height is 1 minimum number of nodes is 2 a root node with one child and not the other Mh  1  Mh  1  Mh  2 While the repeated substitution technique we learned previously isnt a good way to try to
