actual data Does this overhead amount to a significant use of space No because once again the high fanout rate of the tree structure means that the vast majority of nodes are leaf nodes A Kary tree has approximately of its nodes as internal nodes This means that while half of a full binary treeâ€™s nodes are internal nodes in a tree of order 100 probably only about of its nodes are internal nodes This means that the overhead associated with internal nodes is very low We can reduce the number of
