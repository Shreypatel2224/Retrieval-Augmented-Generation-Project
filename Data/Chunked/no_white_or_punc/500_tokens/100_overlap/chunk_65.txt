is Olg n where n is the size of the collection The real win is in the constant factors of course We can choose m so that the pointers to the m children plus the mâˆ’1 elements fill out a cache line at the highest level of the memory hierarchy where we can expect to get cache hits For example if we are accessing a large disk database then our cache lines are memory blocks of the size that is read from disk Lookup in a Btree is straightforward Given a node to start from we use a simple linear or
