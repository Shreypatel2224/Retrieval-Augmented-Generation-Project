condition has two properties The height of a binary search tree meeting the condition is Î˜log n It takes Olog n time to rebalance the tree on insertions and removals In other words it guarantees that the height of the tree is still logarithmic which will give us logarithmictime lookups and the time spent re balancing wont exceed the logarithmic time we would otherwise spend on an insertion or removal when the tree has logarithmic height The cost wont outweigh the benefit Coming up with a
