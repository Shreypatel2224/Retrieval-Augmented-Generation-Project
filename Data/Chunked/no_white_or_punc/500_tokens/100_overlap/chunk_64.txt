the parent node on either side of the subtree pointer This generalizes the BST invariant 5 The root has at least two children if it is not a leaf For example the following is an order5 Btree m5 where the leaves have enough space to store up to 3 data records Because the height of the tree is uniformly the same and every node is at least half full we are guaranteed that the asymptotic performance is Olg n where n is the size of the collection The real win is in the constant factors of course We
