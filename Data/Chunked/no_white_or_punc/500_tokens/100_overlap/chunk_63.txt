only keys Each leaf stores some number of elements the maximum number may be greater or typically less than m The data structure satisfies several invariants 1 Every path from the root to a leaf has the same length 2 If a node has n children it contains nâˆ’1 keys 3 Every node except the root is at least half full 4 The elements stored in a given subtree all have keys that are between the keys in the parent node on either side of the subtree pointer This generalizes the BST invariant 5 The root
